## Data Folder
**salaries_data.csv**: Provided data for testing and training a machine learning model, which includes salaries.

**muestra.csv**: Provided data for making predictions, which does not include salaries.

**muestra(HGRB).csv**: Salaries obtained from the prediction.

**testeo.csv**: Data provided for forecasting purposes, which do not include salaries.
